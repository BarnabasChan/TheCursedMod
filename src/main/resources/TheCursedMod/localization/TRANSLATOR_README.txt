[Note to translators]

If you want to translate this mod to your language, please follow these steps :

1. Make a directory with your 3-digit language code.
2. Copy all .json files in eng/ directory to your directory.
3. Translate!
4. Add your language code to getLanguageString() function in src/main/java/thecursed/TheCursedMod.java.
5. Build the repository to generate .jar files of this mod.
6. Test it by yourself - make sure it does not have any problem during gameplay (e.g. text is truncated).
7. Send me a pull request, and then I'll merge it to the main branch.
8. If step 4-7 are difficult to you, just send me the translated .json files to solderist.park@gmail.com (though I cannot guarantee that they will work without any problem).

IMPORTANT NOTICES
- The word "Strike" in every card should be translated consistently (e.g. "Spiteful Strike"). Otherwise, people would not know that it's affected by "Fury Strike" and also Ironclad's "Perfected Strike".
- Please translate the description of the relic "Dark Magic 101" as short as possible. Otherwise, character selecting screen will show overflown text.
- Make sure all keywords in card description are shown as YELLOW color in the game. If not, check if the keyword is well isolated from other word with space bar.
- Please make keywords CONSISTENT as the original Slay the Spire game. For example, "Gain 5 Armor" is wrong, "Gain 5 Block" is right.

Thanks.
